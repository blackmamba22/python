**Note: I did not create this problem set, it's just a source I found online to
to work on for fun**

Purpose
-------
A module of python3 projects for Computer Science & Software Engineering. This
module will basically be a solution to the projects listed at the link.

First Steps
-----------
+ `Richter Scale <http://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse231/PracticeOfComputingUsingPython/01_Beginnings/FirstWeekProjects/Richter/project01.pdf>`_: Input some numbers, do some simple arithmetic, output results.(Python3)
+ `Windchill <http://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse231/PracticeOfComputingUsingPython/01_Beginnings/FirstWeekProjects/WindChill/project01.pdf>`_: Input some numbers, do some simple arithmetic, output results.(Python3)
+ Arithmetic: Input some numbers, do some simple arithmetic, output results.
+ Gasoline: Input some numbers, do some simple arithmetic on gas and oil quantities, output results.
+ Measurement: Input some numbers, do some simple arithmetic to do silly conversions such as furlongs/fortnight, output results.
+ Population: Input some numbers, do some simple arithmetic to estimate today's U.S. population, output results.
+ Time Travel: Input some numbers, do some simple arithmetic to calculate travel time between stars, output results.
+ Debt: Calculate the height of a stack of bills based on the national debt.

Simple Programs
---------------
+ Number Puzzle: Slayer: Check solutions for a number-word puzzle.
+ Garden, Garden2: Calculate plantings and mulch for a garden. (Python3)
+ Einstein: Solve a simple number puzzle attributed to Einstein.
+ MacArthur: Solve a simple number puzzle attributed to MacArthur.
+ Tones: Calculate frequencies to generate tones on a computer speaker.
+ Turtle Graphics Angles: Use Turtle Graphics to draw two lines and the calculate the angle between them.
+ NinetyNine : Simple number game.

Control
-------
+ `Draw <http://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse231/PracticeOfComputingUsingPython/02_Control/Draw>`_: Draw regular patterns using TurtleGraphics. (Python3)
+ Making Change : Making change.
+ Number Puzzle: SplitNumber: Split numbers into increasing sequences, e.g. 154152 -> 15, 41, 52. (Python3)
+ WaterBilling: Calculate water bills based on category and useage. (Python3)
+ CarRental: Calculate rates for a car rental agency based on category and mileage. (Python3)
+ Trig: Implement basic trigonometric functions using power series. (Python3)
+ LatinSquares: Input two numbers: order and start. Build a Latin square of that order with that starting number.
+ Number Theory: Persistence: Numbers can have interesting properties. Here we look at additive persistence where you sum the digits of a number and then sum the digits of the sumâ€”continue until you get a single digit.
+ Number Theory: Pologinal: The ancient Greeks found number properties to be interesting. A pologinal number is a particular geometric arrangement of a number of balls. Here we find two triangular number that form a given square number.
+ Ancient Egyptian Multiplication: Weird Multiplication: To muliply A by B repeatedly multiply A by 2 while dividing B by 2 until the division has a remainder. If B becomes odd, add A to it. Sum the resulting A and B.
+ Calculator: Make a simple, basic arithmetic calculator. Accept an expression in the form "number operator number", and calculate the result.
+ Bank File Processing: Read a file of banking transactions and keep a ledger. (Python3)
